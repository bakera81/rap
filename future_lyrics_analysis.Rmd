# Intro and Data Inspection
I've set up a database that contains lyrics and additional metadata from all Future songs on Rap Genius. Future is `primary_artist_id == 2197`.

```{r}
# How many songs?
songs %>% 
  nrow()
 # Any duplicates?
songs %>% 
  pull(song_id) %>%
  anyDuplicated()
```

```{r}
# How many languages?
songs %>% 
  count(lyrics_language, sort = T)
```

```{r}
# How many different primary artists?
songs %>% 
  count(primary_artist_id, sort = T)
```

```{r}
# How many songs are "published"?
songs %>% 
  count(published)
```

- There are `r songs %>% nrow()` songs in the dataset.
- There are no duplicated songs in the dataset.
- There are songs in 9 different languages, but `r round(843/866 * 100, 2)`% are in English.
- Future is the primary artist on 407 songs, or `r round(407/866 * 100, 2)`% of the dataset. He is featured in the remaining 457 songs.
- Only 57 of the songs are marked as officially "published" according to Genius.


# Who are Future's collaborators?
### Which artists' songs is Future most commonly featured on?

### Which artists are most commonly featured on Future's songs?
```{r}

### Which artists are Future's most frequent collaborators, regardless of whose song it is?
```{r}

```

### Which producers does Future work with most?
```{r}
songs %>% 
  filter(primary_artist_id == 2197) %>%
  # Some songs have multiple producers
  mutate(produced_by_temp = str_split(produced_by, "\\},")) %>%
  unnest(produced_by_temp) %>%

  select(song_id, produced_by, producer_name) %>%
  filter(!is.na(producer_name)) %>%
  distinct(song_id, producer_name) %>%
